This is an android app which i have create during an internship contest hosted by Toppr Academy on Hackerearth. This app fetches data from a API using
 (Retrofit ) and shows the information in a recycler view and also stores the data in internal phone storage(SQLlite db) .
You can search for an event in the app and you can also mark as favourite some event. This app also plots the pie chart corresponding to the details given using the javascript API to plot the charts.<br>
<br>
Since the API has been disabled by the hackerearth but you can see screenshots.
